OpenVAA ry is a non-profit association incorporated in Finland. It's purpose is to develop open digital tools for democracy with a special emphasis on VAAs or voting advice applications.

Between 2023 and 2025 our focus will on building an open-source platform for VAAs. The project, called likewise OpenVAA, is graciously funded by [Sitra ‚Äì the Finnish innovation fund](https://www.sitra.fi/en/topics/digital-power-and-democracy/).

OpenVAA is accompanied by a research project called **YouthVAA** at the Helsinki University, which studies how VAAs are used and produces a VAA targeted at young, first-time voters. The research project is funded by [Kone Foundation](https://koneensaatio.fi/en/).
